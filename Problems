Problem 2 :
Question:
I give you a list saved in a variable:       a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
Write a Python code that takes this list a[] and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it and another
new list having odd number.

sample output:
INPUT LIST = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
