Bascis:
Problem 1 :
Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. 

Problem 2 :
Question:
I give you a list saved in a variable:       a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
Write a Python code that takes this list a[] and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it and another
new list having odd number.

sample output:
INPUT LIST = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
Output:
Even list [only even numbers want to sorted from INPUT LIST here]
Odd list [only odd numbers want to sorted from INPUT LIST here]
